# 🎨 Cyril's  Browser
An optimized, fully customized Vivaldi browser profile designed for privacy and speed.

This repository hosts a curated configuration that transforms a stock Vivaldi installation into a power-user environment. It pre-configures settings, themes, and extensions so you don't have to set them up manually every time.
## 🚀 Installation

To install my profile you can either extract the .zip / .tar.gz from my Releases in a Vivaldi Profile.

Or you can run this one-liner in PowerShell to install Vivaldi and apply this configuration automatically:
```bash
